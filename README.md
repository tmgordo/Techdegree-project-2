I found this project interesting even though I don't any interest in baseball. It's cool to make multiple moving parts and make them work together. There were a few technical bits that I struggled with, like converting various data types, but what really had me scratching my head was the issue of my code pythonic. I still like I could condense things down and make it more sublime but I'm not sure how.
